You have been invited to <%= @tournament.name %>  by <%=  @inviter.name %>!

A ladder is an ongoing tournament in which you play matches at your own convenience over a period of time to find out
who is the best.  You challenge players ranked up to three slots above you and if you win, you take their spot.

Can you climb the ladder to be the best in ESpace?  Or at least drink lots of beer and have a grand ol' time?

To join the ladder, follow the link: <%= tournament_invite_url(@tournament, @invite) %>
